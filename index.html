            It killed humans, therefore it was a weapon. But radiation killed
            humans, and a medical X-ray machine wasn’t intended as a weapon.
            Holden was starting to feel like they were all monkeys playing with
            a microwave. Push a button, a light comes on inside, so it’s a
            light. Push a different button and stick your hand inside, it burns
            you, so it’s a weapon. Learn to open and close the door, it’s a
            place to hide things. Never grasping what it actually did, and maybe
            not even having the framework necessary to figure it out. No monkey
            ever reheated a frozen burrito.
